# Brain-Tumor-Prediction
This project is a two class classification problem where we grade glioma based on the dataset which has 20 mutated genes and 3 clinical features. The prediction task is to determine whether a pa- tient is Lower-Grade Glioma (LGG) or Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) with a given clinical and molecular/mutation features.
